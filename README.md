# Eat-Da-Burger!

Come and devour as many burgers as you like!

Eat-Da-Burger allows you to add any number of burgers and consume them at your leisure.

Burgers are stored in a MySQL database with their name and state (eaten or uneaten.) Express is used to run the server and the page is rendered with Handlebars. jQuery is then used to interact with the server's API on the page.
